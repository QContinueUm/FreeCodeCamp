I'm generally happy with how this turned out but there are a few changes I want to make when I've learned a bit more about how to implement them.
As a reminder to myself: Dropdown menu (selected text needs to be black and not gray), buttons & checkboxes need custom styling, reset button should also reset dropbox selection, would be nice if Name/Email/Number areas indicated "required" visually somewhere, maybe remove pre-selected radio and checkbox options.
